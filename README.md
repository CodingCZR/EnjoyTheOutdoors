# EnjoyTheOutdoors
Capstone Project for PluralSight


Hello, my name is Cesar Miranda and I will be going over this project through this funny little thing we call a ReadMe file. **Hi Mom**. Just will talk about my thought process and opinions on how I approached this project. 


**Read about the page requirements here: [intro.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Phdfn8J5Uq2jf22jyDodwlGx4PxxCkOI/view?usp=sharing)**

## Steps to Success 
* 1: Visualize my look
* 2: Work on some code
* 3: Get stuck on a code 
* ~~4: Go to Step 2 because you're behind due to step 3~~

### Step 1: Visualizing the Look
> Visualization is subject to change based on factors such as: Time and more Visualization.

While approaching this project, I wanted something really simple. I decided that the best course for me was to bring in something I have already done.

*A transparent Navbar*

###Sketches:

 *I know, I know, it's a mess to look at but I was at work and had a sudden inspiration. So I had to do what I had to do.*

Breaking it down: It's a Navbar and Image in the same block. Which is where my transparent Bar comes into play. Allows it to flow into my other page. 

The bottom is just navigating to the pages.

This was easy. Just took some notes from how my homepage is displayed and applied to this one. I was more focused on the card presenting when prompted.

### Step 2: Working on some code.
Luckily for me, I already sketched out my home page and mountain page so building these were a bit simple. Connected with my friend known as Bootstrap and went to work. 

I did add a transition to my navbar from the opacity to a solid color. Which was a bit of a challenge since I have a grasp of JS the size of a Cutie orange. *Thank you random person who decided to make a video on it.*

### Step 3: Get Stuck on Code

The Javascript, my biggest enemy...to say I struggled was an understatement. I don't know what it is but using Javascript to create cards when things were filtered was driving me crazy.

>Crazy? I was crazy once. I was in a rubber room. A rubber room with rubber rats. I hate rubber rats, they make me crazy. Crazy?...

I toughed it out and thanks to my peers got that solved. *Also a huge shoutout to the random internet users who sacrifice their pride and ask the internet for help.*

### ~~4: Go to Step 2 because you're behind due to step 3~~

>Time, a relentless foe in our projects, imposes deadlines and urgency. Failing to manage it effectively jeopardizes goals, making time a tangible threat to our aspirations and deadlines. It prompts a crucial need for adept time management to ensure project success. - ChatGPT

Time is like an ex-girlfriend. You have it and when you don't realize it, it's gone and attending University of Santa Cruz.

*So they say*

I could have managed my time better. I had some ideas but I genuinely just got lost in the Javascript. I felt pretty good about everything though and I hope that I make it a point of emphasis to give myself more time. 

## Final Opinions

This project was a fun headache to have and I can't wait to see what our last capstone has in hold for us.
