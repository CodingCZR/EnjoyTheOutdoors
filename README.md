### Capstone Project for PluralSight

Welcome! My name is Cesar Miranda, and in this README file, I'll guide you through my thought process and approach to this project. Let's dive in!

For a detailed overview of the page requirements, please refer to the following document: [intro.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Phdfn8J5Uq2jf22jyDodwlGx4PxxCkOI/view?usp=sharing)

## Project Steps
1. Visualize the design
2. Write the code
3. Troubleshoot issues
4. Iterate and refine

### Step 1: Visualizing the Design

Visualization is dynamic and subject to change based on factors such as time constraints and new insights. Initially, I aimed for a simple yet functional design, leveraging previous work to streamline the process.

**Sketches:**
- [Home Page Rough Draft](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MQpihY4BcegiU0Qx7jNvD8cyu02uixR7/view?usp=sharing)
  - *Note: This is a preliminary sketch created during a moment of inspiration at work.*
  - **Description:** The design includes a transparent navbar and an image within the same block, allowing a seamless flow between pages.

- [Mountain Page Sketch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18afzZl86O_u9fJfGZfj4lsDaNV9G7ym7/view?usp=drive_link)
  - **Description:** This page mirrors the homepage's layout with a focus on card presentation when prompted.

### Step 2: Writing the Code

With the sketches in hand, I started coding the home and mountain pages. Using Bootstrap, I added a transition to the navbar, changing its opacity to a solid colorâ€”a task that challenged my limited JavaScript skills. Special thanks to online tutorials for their guidance.

### Step 3: Troubleshooting Code

JavaScript posed significant challenges, especially with creating dynamic cards upon filtering. Persistent effort and support from peers helped overcome these hurdles. Shoutout to the helpful internet community!

### Step 4: Refining and Iterating

Time management was critical, and although I faced delays due to JavaScript issues, the experience reinforced the importance of effective time allocation.

## Final Thoughts

This project, though challenging, was incredibly rewarding. I look forward to tackling our final capstone project with the lessons learned from this experience.
